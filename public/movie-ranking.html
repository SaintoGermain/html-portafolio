<h1>Movie Ranking by Germain</h1>
<h2>Top 5 Movies of all time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Drive</h3>
<p>
   We got another movie where Ryan Gosling does a great acting job, we can feel the stress miles away every single second the movie goes by,
    as well we have different plot-twists that can get us.

<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>
   Amazing movie to watch with friends, if you get the different jokes it has all along the movie
   you can get a very fun time watching it!
</p>

<h3>Godzilla</h3>
<p>
   Adding this movie to my top because it's always something I like to see, a big prehistoric monster
   that can destroy a whole city with its radioactive laser, just to have a great time and distract from every day life!
