<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Germain Mendez! I'm from Puebla, Mexico.</p>

<p>I'm 23 years old and I'm currently studying Computer Science Engineering at BUAP, I'm half way to finish my major.
  I own two little entrepreneurships that I just started altough they're not related to my major.
  I've been in the USA two times where I was able to practice my English skills, even though I've never done an English test
  I can tell that it has improved all along this time thanks to travel.
</p>

<p>I want to improve my programming skills and knowledge in computer science and engineering by working
  in any area so I can start focusing in some especific area, that's the reason why I'm making a projects portafolio.
  I worked in different programming languages just as Java, C++, CSS, Javascript, Python and Flutter, I made diverse projects in college just as little RPG videogames or just little shop inventories
  using data structures.
  I'm  currently learning about databases in SQL and developing a mobile app using flutter for a college project.
  I worked as a team in most of these projects, taking leadership, focusing on management and completing tasks in the allotted time, just as well doing documentation when it comes to engineering area.
  I hope to know more about you soon!
  Have a nice day.
